        <h1>About Pollution</h1>
        <p>Pollution is the presence of substances in the environment that are harmful or have poisonous effects. It is a global issue affecting air, water, and soil, and it threatens the health of all living organisms, including humans.</p>
        
        <h2>What Causes Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Pollution is caused by both natural processes and human activities. Human-induced causes include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, deforestation, improper waste management, and excessive use of plastics. Natural causes may include volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and dust storms.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Pollution</h2>
        <p>Pollution is categorized into several types based on the affected environmental component. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Air Pollution:</b> Contaminants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulates harm the atmosphere and living organisms.</li>
            <li><b>Water Pollution:</b> Discharge of harmful chemicals, plastics, and untreated sewage into water bodies affects marine life and water quality.</li>
            <li><b>Soil Pollution:</b> Dumping of hazardous waste, pesticides, and industrial chemicals damages soil fertility and plant health.</li>
            <li><b>Noise Pollution:</b> Excessive sound levels from urbanization, industries, and transportation disrupt ecosystems and human health.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Impact of Pollution</h2>
        <p>The effects of pollution are far-reaching and devastating. It contributes to global warming, acid rain, ozone layer depletion, and habitat destruction. For humans, pollution leads to respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and waterborne illnesses.</p>

        <h2>What Can We Do to Reduce Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Reducing pollution requires a collaborative effort. Some key actions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using renewable energy sources like solar and wind energy.</li>
            <li>Promoting the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.</li>
            <li>Adopting sustainable practices in agriculture and industry.</li>
            <li>Implementing stricter environmental regulations.</li>
            <li>Raising awareness and educating people about pollution and its consequences.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let us work together to combat pollution and create a sustainable and healthy environment for future generations.</p>
