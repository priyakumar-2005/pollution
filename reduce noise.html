        <h2>1. Urban Planning and Zoning</h2>
        <p>Strategic city planning can help minimize noise pollution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designate quieter zones in residential areas away from busy roads and industries.</li>
            <li>Use soundproofing materials in the construction of buildings near highways and airports.</li>
            <li>Implement noise barriers along major roads and railways.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of Noise Barriers and Soundproofing</h2>
        <p>Installing sound barriers and using soundproofing materials can effectively reduce noise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Construct noise barriers along highways, railways, and airports to block sound.</li>
            <li>Apply soundproof windows, doors, and insulation materials in residential buildings near noise sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Regulation of Noise Emissions</h2>
        <p>Governments and organizations can introduce noise regulations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enforce strict regulations on industrial noise emissions, including machinery and factory operations.</li>
            <li>Implement noise limits for vehicles and public transport systems.</li>
            <li>Promote quiet machinery and equipment in industries and construction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Traffic Control and Public Transportation</h2>
        <p>Reducing traffic-related noise is crucial in urban areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage the use of electric vehicles (EVs) which produce less noise compared to traditional vehicles.</li>
            <li>Improve public transportation systems to reduce reliance on personal vehicles.</li>
            <li>Use quieter road surfaces and implement speed limit restrictions in residential areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Landscaping and Vegetation</h2>
        <p>Natural solutions such as landscaping can help mitigate noise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plant trees and shrubs along roads and railways to absorb and deflect sound.</li>
            <li>Install green walls in urban spaces to reduce noise reflection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Public Awareness and Education</h2>
        <p>Raising awareness is essential for reducing noise pollution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educate the public about the harmful effects of noise pollution on health.</li>
            <li>Encourage the use of quieter appliances and equipment in homes and businesses.</li>
            <li>Promote community initiatives to reduce unnecessary noise in public spaces.</li>
        </ul>
